# resite

This file provides the information required to set up the __resite__ tool. Also, it provides a minimal example for siting
RES assets.  

# Setup

This module runs in any 3.x version of Python. The Python packages required to run this module are listed 
in the `requirements.yml` file included in the repository. Their installation can be easily achieved via the the following
command that builds a separate environment for this module from the `yml` file:
   
    conda env create -f environment.yml

The tool requires to installation of an MILP solver. At the time of writing, `gurobi` is the only solver this 
model supports (see installation details [here](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/8.1/remoteservices/installation.html).
